# Exercise 1: Linear-Regression
In this exercise, you will implement linear regression and get to see it work
on data. Before starting on this programming exercise, we strongly recom-
mend watching the video lectures and completing the review questions for
the associated topics.
<br />
To get started with the exercise, you will need to download the starter
code and unzip its contents to the directory where you wish to complete the
exercise. If needed, use the cd command in Octave/MATLAB to change to
this directory before starting this exercise.
<br />
You can also find instructions for installing Octave/MATLAB in the \En-
vironment Setup Instructions" of the course website.
